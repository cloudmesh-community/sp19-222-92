Dataset and question:

Can data gathered from athletic practices and games be used to create benchmarks for how an athlete playing a specific position should perform? Recent advancements in different technologies have allowed us to use data from sensors to instantly improve how people and things perform.  Edge computing was used on that data to showcase that data from athletes can help them improve just as well as it can help machines improve. With edge computing, one can get real-time results which can target specific data points from the measured data so that those who are interested can easily see what needs immediate attention for the athlete to improve. Practice and game data gotten from the Indiana University Women&#39;s Soccer team was used to see if athlete data could be used to show coaches and players if the players are playing at the level that they could playing at. The data from the Women&#39;s team has some individual columns, such as sprints, that could be used to show the athletes and coaches what they need to improve on without having to make any computations on that data point. Although using data in that way can help the player improve their speed, it will do very little to show them how they need to improve their overall ability. The main point of the data is to improve the player at their specific sport, not just how fast they can run. Using certain algorithms such as Kmeans on the data can show the player what they need to do to better their game as a whole because it can be graphed and used to compare themselves against others who play the position better. This method can sometimes be inefficient because what is &quot;good&quot; can very a lot in soccer.  For example, some defenders do not run very much at all, but instead rely on their ability to read players movements to stop the opposing players from getting past them. This would be a great data point that likely be used to create more accurate models that can help the players distinguish themselves from the other positions in terms of how they should be performing, but the problem is that this type of ability cannot be measured. A big downfall of edge computing when it comes to helping athletes improve is that many things which make some athletes great are skills which are not yet able to be detected by any sort of sensory technology. To avoid any of these limitations, the dataset attained from the Indiana University Women&#39;s Soccer team has many data points which are essentially the same except that they are measured in different ranges. This way of measuring data could surpass the inability to measure the &quot;intangibles&quot; because it measures many data points at the same instance. The game data that was gotten from the Women&#39;s team was gotten from the 2018 season where they faced off with many of the other Big 10 schools. There were eleven datasets in which each contained a row for each of the players where you could see their names and all of their data points for that particular game. Since each dataset had only 23 data points we decided to join all of the datasets into one big dataset where the player&#39;s names were removed and replaced by the indexes of the rows. The original datasets that were given to us did not contain the minutes played, which could alter how the kmeans algorithm clusters the players by their positions. The algorithm would likely cluster the players wrongly if the &quot;Minutes Played&quot; column was not added because it would give the players who are substitutes higher numbers without taking into account that the amount of time that they played. In soccer, the amount of time you play can especially effect many of your stats because the sport is largely based on endurance with a few short bursts of sprints.

# Algorithm:

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that takes an unlabeled dataset and finds groups within data without defined categories. The idea is to look at the average or mean values that can be clustered and how many groups of k that are related in some way. When using this algorithm, the hope is that the results can explain why common parameter values are in the same group. This algorithm takes numerical values that describe a coordinated value within a data set. For example, K-Means is beneficial for this project because is able to focus on a particular data set for the women&#39;s soccer team at Indiana University-Bloomington and compare that to users data. For the coordinates, K-Means can represent and describe many different things such as elections, medical test, sports teams, or wine data. Typical you use K-means on a dataset to get the model of the data, this is used to see the behaviors and analyze the patterns the data set. When using clustering methods variance becomes an important topic trying to understand the math behind this algorithm. Variance is a measurement of how far data values are from the mean. By look at the variance equation, it shows that it is a measure of the square difference between the data points and the mean value and then the average. When using the K-means algorithm one of the key points is to measure the closeness of the data to its average which led into cluster variance which divides the data into clusters, each will have its own average.

Before landing on K-means to be the machine learning algorithm, spectral clustering was the set machine learning algorithm for finding out how close people were playing against Indiana University women&#39;s soccer team. Spectral clustering is a popular machine learning algorithm used in recent years according to Von Luxburg, in A tutorial on spectral clustering. This algorithm can be effectively solved by using standard linear algebra methods and, software. For the most part, it is known to outperform K-means which is what was seen with this data set. Spectral clustering uses the data points as nodes of a graphed, which is then treated partitioning problem and mapped to a low-dimensional space making it easier to form clusters. Spectral clustering follows an approach where if the points are extremely close to each other they are put into the same cluster, even if the distance between them is within a 2 point range if they are not connected they are not clustered. While k-means points can be within the same range and still fall within the same group because it&#39;s measured by the distance between the data. This data set has many points where they are considered within range of each other which is why spectral clustering gave better results. In spectral clustering the data had to be connected within a way which led them to fall within the same cluster. The problem arises when using spectral clustering because the project aims to show people how they played compared to Indiana University soccer players it but when trying to show their data and the soccer players data on the same plot issues arise. This happens because you can not get the labels using spectral clusters so the use would not know where they where.

Dimension reduction was something that was needed for this data set because there were many points within one player&#39;s statistics. Having multiple points,  was too much for K-means to give explainable results. Dimension reduction allowed the data set to be reduced to a certain number of random variables by obtaining a set of key variables. Looking at dimension reduction from the math perspective there are the non-linear and linear methods.
