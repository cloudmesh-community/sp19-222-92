Dataset and question:

Can data gathered from athletic practices and games be used to create benchmarks for how an athlete playing a specific position should perform? Recent advancements in different technologies have allowed us to use data from sensors to instantly improve how people and things perform.  Edge computing was used on that data to showcase that data from athletes can help them improve just as well as it can help machines improve. With edge computing, one can get real-time results which can target specific data points from the measured data so that those who are interested can easily see what needs immediate attention for the athlete to improve. Practice and game data gotten from the Indiana University Women&#39;s Soccer team was used to see if athlete data could be used to show coaches and players if the players are playing at the level that they could playing at. The data from the Women&#39;s team has some individual columns, such as sprints, that could be used to show the athletes and coaches what they need to improve on without having to make any computations on that data point. Although using data in that way can help the player improve their speed, it will do very little to show them how they need to improve their overall ability. The main point of the data is to improve the player at their specific sport, not just how fast they can run. Using certain algorithms such as Kmeans on the data can show the player what they need to do to better their game as a whole because it can be graphed and used to compare themselves against others who play the position better. This method can sometimes be inefficient because what is &quot;good&quot; can very a lot in soccer.  For example, some defenders do not run very much at all, but instead rely on their ability to read players movements to stop the opposing players from getting past them. This would be a great data point that likely be used to create more accurate models that can help the players distinguish themselves from the other positions in terms of how they should be performing, but the problem is that this type of ability cannot be measured. A big downfall of edge computing when it comes to helping athletes improve is that many things which make some athletes great are skills which are not yet able to be detected by any sort of sensory technology. To avoid any of these limitations, the dataset attained from the Indiana University Women&#39;s Soccer team has many data points which are essentially the same except that they are measured in different ranges. This way of measuring data could surpass the inability to measure the &quot;intangibles&quot; because it measures many data points at the same instance. The game data that was gotten from the Women&#39;s team was gotten from the 2018 season where they faced off with many of the other Big 10 schools. There were eleven datasets in which each contained a row for each of the players where you could see their names and all of their data points for that particular game. Since each dataset had only 23 data points we decided to join all of the datasets into one big dataset where the player&#39;s names were removed and replaced by the indexes of the rows. The original datasets that were given to us did not contain the minutes played, which could alter how the kmeans algorithm clusters the players by their positions. The algorithm would likely cluster the players wrongly if the &quot;Minutes Played&quot; column was not added because it would give the players who are substitutes higher numbers without taking into account that the amount of time that they played. In soccer, the amount of time you play can especially effect many of your stats because the sport is largely based on endurance with a few short bursts of sprints.
